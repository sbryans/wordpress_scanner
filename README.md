# WordPress Scanner

Written in Ruby, this terminal based application performs a GET request to the URI of choice. HTML is parsed, three tags are targeted (meta, link, img) - then scanned for the string value "wp-content". This same operation is then performed on the sitemap.xml file associated with SEO smart websites. Enjoy!!!

## How to

1. Navigate to the application's working directory
2. bundle install
